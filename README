=============================

This was a simple, one-page site built to encourage people to think-twice about continuing to use Feedburner at a time when it looked increasingly likely that Google would shut it down.

Aesthetically, it was modeled to look like a Google login page.

Structurally, it makes use of the Skeleton framework.
